Hey there! Basically these files were just the example and homework code I wrote in Java as an assistant AP Java Instructor!
Examples basically include sorting algorithms, introduction to binary trees and Binary Seart Trees as well as other examples
to engage students in Object Oriented Programming and learning.

This is all in Java - it also includes answers to coding challenges prompted by the Coding Olympiad
